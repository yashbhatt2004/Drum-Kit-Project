D: Generates the sound of Tom-4.
J: Activates the Snare sound.
K: Plays the Crash cymbal sound.

3. <h3>User-Friendly Interface</h3>
The interface is designed for ease of use, with clearly labeled buttons corresponding to each drum element. Users can easily identify and interact with the drum kit to produce sounds.
